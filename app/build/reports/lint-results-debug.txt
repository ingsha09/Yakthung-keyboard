/storage/emulated/0/Yakthung-keyboard/app/build.gradle.kts:12: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        targetSdk = 33
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than
   your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with, various
   compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues
   to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the targetSdkVersion
   is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:

/storage/emulated/0/Yakthung-keyboard/app/src/main/java/com/yakthung/keyboard/YakthungKeyboardService.java:24: Warning: Avoid passing null as the view root (needed to resolve layout parameters on the inflated layout's root element) [InflateParams]
        keyboardView = (KeyboardView) getLayoutInflater().inflate(R.layout.input_view, null);
                                                                                       ~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "InflateParams":
   When inflating a layout, avoid passing in null as the parent view, since
   otherwise any layout parameters on the root of the inflated layout will be
   ignored.

/storage/emulated/0/Yakthung-keyboard/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:21: Warning: Redundant label can be removed [RedundantLabel]
            android:label="@string/app_name"
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "RedundantLabel":
   When an activity does not have a label attribute, it will use the one from
   the application tag. Since the application has already specified the same
   label, the label on this activity can be omitted.

/storage/emulated/0/Yakthung-keyboard/app/build.gradle.kts:40: Warning: A newer version of com.google.android.material:material than 1.9.0 is available: 1.12.0 [GradleDependency]

                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/storage/emulated/0/Yakthung-keyboard/app/build.gradle.kts:41: Warning: A newer version of androidx.appcompat:appcompat than 1.6.1 is available: 1.7.0 [GradleDependency]

/storage/emulated/0/Yakthung-keyboard/app/build.gradle.kts:42: Warning: A newer version of androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout than 2.1.4 is available: 2.2.0 [GradleDependency]
    implementation("androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:2.1.4")
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

/storage/emulated/0/Yakthung-keyboard/app/src/main/res/mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_launcher.xml:2: Warning: The application adaptive icon is missing a monochrome tag [MonochromeLauncherIcon]
<adaptive-icon xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
^
/storage/emulated/0/Yakthung-keyboard/app/src/main/res/mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_launcher_round.xml:2: Warning: The application adaptive roundIcon is missing a monochrome tag [MonochromeLauncherIcon]
<adaptive-icon xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
^

   Explanation for issues of type "MonochromeLauncherIcon":
   If android:roundIcon and android:icon are both in your manifest, you must
   either remove the reference to android:roundIcon if it is not needed; or,
   supply the monochrome icon in the drawable defined by the android:roundIcon
   and android:icon attribute.

   For example, if android:roundIcon and android:icon are both in the
   manifest, a launcher might choose to use android:roundIcon over
   android:icon to display the adaptive app icon. Therefore, your themed
   application iconwill not show if your monochrome attribute is not also
   specified in android:roundIcon.

/storage/emulated/0/Yakthung-keyboard/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml:41: Warning: This text field does not specify an inputType [TextFields]
        <EditText
         ~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "TextFields":
   Providing an inputType attribute on a text field improves usability because
   depending on the data to be input, optimized keyboards can be shown to the
   user (such as just digits and parentheses for a phone number). 

   The lint detector also looks at the id of the view, and if the id offers a
   hint of the purpose of the field (for example, the id contains the phrase
   phone or email), then lint will also ensure that the inputType contains the
   corresponding type attributes.

   If you really want to keep the text field generic, you can suppress this
   warning by setting inputType="text".

/storage/emulated/0/Yakthung-keyboard/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml:41: Warning: Missing autofillHints attribute [Autofill]
        <EditText
         ~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "Autofill":
   Specify an autofillHints attribute when targeting SDK version 26 or higher
   or explicitly specify that the view is not important for autofill. Your app
   can help an autofill service classify the data correctly by providing the
   meaning of each view that could be autofillable, such as views representing
   usernames, passwords, credit card fields, email addresses, etc.

   The hints can have any value, but it is recommended to use predefined
   values like 'username' for a username or 'creditCardNumber' for a credit
   card number. For a list of all predefined autofill hint constants, see the
   AUTOFILL_HINT_ constants in the View reference at
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html.

   You can mark a view unimportant for autofill by specifying an
   importantForAutofill attribute on that view or a parent view. See
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setImportant
   ForAutofill(int).

/storage/emulated/0/Yakthung-keyboard/app/src/main/java/com/yakthung/keyboard/MainActivity.java:23: Warning: String literal in setText can not be translated. Use Android resources instead. [SetTextI18n]
        binding.textView.setText("Welcome to Yakthung Keyboard!");
                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "SetTextI18n":
   When calling TextView#setText
   * Never call Number#toString() to format numbers; it will not handle
   fraction separators and locale-specific digits properly. Consider using
   String#format with proper format specifications (%d or %f) instead.
   * Do not pass a string literal (e.g. "Hello") to display text. Hardcoded
   text can not be properly translated to other languages. Consider using
   Android resource strings instead.
   * Do not build messages by concatenating text chunks. Such messages can not
   be properly translated.

/storage/emulated/0/Yakthung-keyboard/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml:30: Warning: Hardcoded string "Enable Yakthung Keyboard", should use @string resource [HardcodedText]
             android:text="Enable Yakthung Keyboard" />
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/storage/emulated/0/Yakthung-keyboard/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml:39: Warning: Hardcoded string "Set as Default Keyboard", should use @string resource [HardcodedText]
             android:text="Set as Default Keyboard" />
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/storage/emulated/0/Yakthung-keyboard/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml:45: Warning: Hardcoded string "Type here to preview Yakthung Keyboard", should use @string resource [HardcodedText]
             android:hint="Type here to preview Yakthung Keyboard"
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "HardcodedText":
   Hardcoding text attributes directly in layout files is bad for several
   reasons:

   * When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or
   portrait) you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when
   making changes)

   * The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding
   new translations for existing string resources.

   There are quickfixes to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a
   resource lookup.
